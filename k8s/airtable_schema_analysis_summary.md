## Schema Architecture Overview

### Core Entity Groups

#### 1. Project Management Core (7 tables)

### Complex Field Type Distribution

| Field Type | Count | Percentage | Complexity Impact |
|------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| singleLineText | 152 | 28.2% | Low |
| multipleRecordLinks | 88 | 16.3% | **Very High** |
| formula | 67 | 12.4% | **High** |
| multipleLookupValues | 54 | 10.0% | **High** |
| number | 53 | 9.8% | Low |
| singleSelect | 49 | 9.1% | Medium |
| date | 38 | 7.0% | Low |
| rollup | 12 | 2.2% | **High** |
| Other types | 26 | 4.8% | Variable |

## Critical Multi-Tenant Challenges Identified

### 1. **Extensive Cross-Table Dependencies**
- **88 relationship fields** create a web of interconnected data
- Changes in one tenant's data could theoretically affect calculations in another tenant's space
- **Formula fields** often reference multiple tables, creating potential data leakage risks

### 2. **Shared Reference Data Patterns**
The system uses shared "library" tables that multiple project tables reference:
- `Work library` → Referenced by 15+ project cost breakdown tables
- `Materials denmark` → Referenced by 14+ project tables  
- `MATERIAL BULGARIA` → Referenced by 3+ project tables

**Risk**: In a multi-tenant scenario, tenants might inadvertently share pricing/material data.

### 3. **Complex Calculated Fields**
Many tables have **formula**, **rollup**, and **lookup** fields that:
- Aggregate data across multiple tables
- Perform complex business calculations
- Could create performance bottlenecks in multi-tenant scenarios

### 4. **Naming Patterns Suggest Project Duplication**
Multiple tables follow the pattern `[Project Name] copy` suggesting a workflow where projects are duplicated and customized. This pattern could complicate tenant isolation.

## Recommended Multi-Tenant Strategy

### Tenant Isolation Approach: **Schema-per-Tenant**

Given the complexity and interconnectedness, recommend **full schema duplication per tenant** rather than row-level tenant isolation:

#### Advantages:
- **Complete data isolation** - No risk of cross-tenant data leakage
- **Performance isolation** - Complex calculations don't impact other tenants
- **Customization flexibility** - Each tenant can modify their schema
- **Simplified backup/restore** - Tenant data is cleanly separated

#### Implementation Considerations:

1. **Base Template Management**
   ```python
   # Pseudocode for tenant provisioning
   def provision_new_tenant(tenant_id, base_template_id):
       # Clone the complex schema structure
       new_base = airtable.clone_base(base_template_id)
       # Update with tenant-specific configuration
       tenant_config = {
           'base_id': new_base.id,
           'tenant_id': tenant_id,
           'created_at': datetime.now()
       }
       return new_base
   ```

2. **Reference Data Handling**
   - **Work library** and **Materials** tables should be tenant-specific
   - Consider maintaining a "master catalog" that can be imported/updated
   - Allow tenant customization of pricing and materials

3. **API Access Control**
   ```python
   # Tenant-scoped API wrapper
   class TenantScopedAirtable:
       def __init__(self, tenant_id):
           self.base_id = get_tenant_base_id(tenant_id)
           self.client = AirtableClient(base_id=self.base_id)
       
       def get_projects(self):
           # Automatically scoped to tenant's base
           return self.client.get('Projects')
   ```

### Alternative: **Hybrid Approach**

For specific use cases, consider a hybrid model:
- **Shared reference data** (Work library, Materials) in a central base
- **Tenant-specific project data** in separate bases
- **API gateway** manages cross-base relationships

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### 1. **Caching Strategy**
```python
# Cache complex calculations
@cache(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour cache
def get_project_total_cost(project_id):
    # Expensive rollup calculation
    return sum_rollup_fields(project_id)
```

### 2. **Batch Operations**
- Use batch APIs for bulk updates to related records
- Implement change detection to minimize unnecessary calculations

### 3. **Monitoring Metrics**
- Track API call patterns per tenant
- Monitor formula calculation times
- Alert on unusual cross-table query patterns

## Data Migration Considerations

### Schema Evolution
- **Version control** for base templates
- **Migration scripts** for schema updates across tenants
- **Backwards compatibility** for API changes

### Data Integrity
- **Validation rules** to prevent orphaned relationships
- **Cleanup procedures** for deleted records
- **Audit trails** for data changes

## Cost Estimation Impact

### API Usage Patterns
Based on the relationship complexity, expect:
- **High read/write ratios** due to calculated fields
- **Cascading updates** when core data changes
- **Increased API calls** for relationship traversal

### Storage Considerations
- **34 tables × N tenants** = significant base proliferation
- Consider **archiving strategies** for completed projects
- **Data compression** for attachment storage

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Load Testing Scenarios**
- Multiple tenants performing complex calculations simultaneously
- Large batch operations across relationship fields
- Formula recalculation under load

### 2. **Isolation Testing**
- Verify no data leakage between tenant bases
- Test API access control boundaries
- Validate calculation independence

### 3. **Performance Benchmarking**
- Measure impact of relationship depth on query times
- Test rollup/lookup field performance at scale
- Monitor memory usage during complex operations

## Conclusion

This Airtable base represents one of the most complex schema structures suitable for testing multi-tenant capabilities. The extensive use of relationships, calculated fields, and cross-table dependencies makes it an excellent stress test for:

- **Data isolation strategies**
- **Performance optimization techniques**  
- **API design patterns for complex schemas**
- **Tenant provisioning workflows**

The recommended **schema-per-tenant** approach, while requiring more storage overhead, provides the cleanest separation of concerns and best performance characteristics for this level of complexity.
