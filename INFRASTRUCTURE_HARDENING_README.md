# Infrastructure Security Hardening

This document outlines the comprehensive security hardening implemented for the PyAirtable Compose infrastructure, designed for enterprise production environments.

## Overview

The production infrastructure hardening includes:

- **Container Security**: Read-only filesystems, non-root users, security contexts
- **Network Security**: Isolated networks, firewall rules, rate limiting
- **Secrets Management**: Docker secrets, encrypted storage, rotation policies
- **TLS/SSL**: End-to-end encryption, strong cipher suites, HSTS
- **Monitoring & Observability**: LGTM stack with security alerting
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning with Trivy
- **Compliance**: Production-ready security controls

## Security Architecture

## Security Controls Implementation

### Container Security Controls

#### Image Hardening
```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
read_only: true
tmpfs:
  - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m
```

#### Resource Controls
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '1.0'
      memory: 1G
    reservations:
      cpus: '0.25'
      memory: 256M
```

#### Health Monitoring
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "health-check-command"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

### Network Security Controls

#### Firewall Rules
```bash
# Public access (restricted)
80/tcp   - HTTP (redirect to HTTPS)
443/tcp  - HTTPS (TLS terminated at nginx)

# Management access (IP restricted)
9090/tcp - Prometheus (monitoring networks only)
3000/tcp - Grafana (monitoring networks only)

# Blocked by default
All other ports denied
```

#### Rate Limiting
```nginx
# Global rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=global:10m rate=1000r/m;

# API rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=100r/m;

# Authentication rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login:10m rate=5r/m;
```

### TLS/SSL Security

#### Certificate Configuration
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.2+ only
- **Ciphers**: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 and stronger
- **HSTS**: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
- **OCSP Stapling**: Enabled for certificate validation

#### Security Headers
```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'..." always;
```

### Database Security

#### PostgreSQL Hardening
- **Authentication**: SCRAM-SHA-256 only
- **Encryption**: TLS for all connections
- **Access Control**: Row-level security enabled
