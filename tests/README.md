## Architecture Patterns Coverage

### 1. End-to-End Test Scenarios
- **SAGA Workflow Testing**: User registration workflow with compensation
- **CQRS Projections**: Command/Query separation with event projections
- **Event Sourcing**: Event replay and state reconstruction validation
- **Outbox Pattern**: Reliable message delivery verification
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction boundary testing

### 2. Service Integration Tests
- **API Gateway**: Routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Service-to-service contracts
- **Database Transactions**: ACID compliance and isolation
- **Cache Invalidation**: Redis cache coherency
- **Event Bus**: Message flow and delivery guarantees

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- **Docker Containers**: Isolated test environments
- **Test Data Management**: Factories and fixtures
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Load and stress testing
- **Chaos Engineering**: Failure injection and resilience
- **Contract Testing**: API compatibility verification

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup test environment
make setup-test-env

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run specific test types
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-e2e
make test-performance

# Generate reports
make test-reports
```

## Environment Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Go 1.21+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+

## Configuration

Tests can be configured through environment variables or configuration files:

```bash
# Test environment configuration
export TEST_ENV=integration
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5433/test_db
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380
export API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with:
- Parallel execution
- Test result reporting
- Coverage tracking
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability alerts

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the test organization structure
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Add appropriate fixtures and mocks
4. Update documentation
5. Ensure tests are deterministic and fast
