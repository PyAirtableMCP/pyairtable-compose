# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN: Emergency Stabilization & Recovery

**Executive Summary**: 2-week emergency stabilization plan focused on achievable wins to build credibility, followed by structured 8-week recovery program.

**Current Reality Check**:
- 4/6 core services currently running (67% success rate)
- 2 healthy services: platform-services, airtable-gateway
- 27 Go modules, 14 Python services - massive over-engineering
- 21 Docker Compose configurations - configuration chaos

## WEEK 1: IMMEDIATE WINS (Must Succeed)

### Quick Win #1: Stabilize Current Working Stack (Days 1-2)
**Goal**: Get to 100% service health with current minimal stack

**Actions**:
1. Fix airtable-gateway health check (currently unhealthy but responsive)
2. Add missing automation-services to running stack
3. Test end-to-end API flow from client → platform → airtable
4. Document working API endpoints

**Success Criteria**: All 4 core services reporting healthy, API endpoints documented

### Quick Win #2: Create Single Production-Ready Configuration (Days 3-4)
**Goal**: Eliminate 21 Docker Compose files chaos

**Actions**:
1. Consolidate to 3 configs: base, dev, production
2. Create production-ready docker-compose.production.yml
3. Test production deployment locally
4. Create deployment runbook

**Success Criteria**: Single command deployment working, documented procedures

### Quick Win #3: Implement Basic Monitoring Dashboard (Day 5)
**Goal**: Real-time visibility into system health

**Actions**:
1. Deploy Grafana + Prometheus stack from existing monitoring/
2. Connect to current 4 services health endpoints
3. Create simple dashboard showing service status
4. Set up basic alerting

**Success Criteria**: Dashboard showing all service metrics, alerts working

## WEEK 2: STABILIZATION FOUNDATION

### Deliverable #1: Service Consolidation Plan (Days 6-7)
**Goal**: Define target architecture for 8-week recovery

**Actions**:
1. Create service consolidation matrix (current 41 services → target 6)
2. Define domain boundaries and service ownership
3. Create migration timeline with dependencies
4. Get stakeholder approval

**Success Criteria**: Written consolidation plan approved by team

### Deliverable #2: Docker Configuration Cleanup (Days 8-9)
**Goal**: Eliminate configuration sprawl

**Actions**:
1. Archive unused docker-compose.*.yml files
2. Standardize remaining 3 configurations
3. Create environment variable templates
4. Test all configurations work

**Success Criteria**: 3 working configs, unused ones archived

### Deliverable #3: CI/CD Quick Setup (Day 10)
**Goal**: Automated deployment pipeline

**Actions**:
1. Create GitHub Actions for current 4 services
2. Implement automated testing pipeline
3. Set up deployment to staging environment
4. Create rollback procedure

**Success Criteria**: Automated deployment working, tests passing

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 5-6): Data Layer Consolidation
**Objective**: Unify data access patterns

**Target Services**:
- Merge: airtable-gateway + schema-service + mcp-server → **data-integration-service**
- Result: Single Python service for external data operations
- Delete: 3 separate services + configurations

**Success Metrics**:
- Services reduced from 39 → 37
- Airtable operations 100% functional
- API response times maintained

**Go/No-Go Checkpoint**: Data retrieval performance ≥ current baseline

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-8): AI/ML Services Consolidation
**Objective**: Consolidate AI/ML processing

**Target Services**:
- Merge: llm-orchestrator + ai-service + embedding-service → **ai-processing-service**
- Result: Single Python service for all AI operations
- Delete: 3 separate services

**Success Metrics**:
- Services reduced from 37 → 35
- LLM responses working correctly
- Cost per request maintained

**Go/No-Go Checkpoint**: AI response quality ≥ current performance

### Sprint 4 (Weeks 9-10): Workflow & Communication Consolidation
**Objective**: Final service consolidation

**Target Services**:
- Merge: workflow-engine + automation-services → **workflow-service**
- Merge: notification-service + webhook-service → **communication-service**
- Result: 2 consolidated services

**Success Metrics**:
- Services reduced from 35 → 6 final services
- All workflows functional
- End-to-end tests passing

**Go/No-Go Checkpoint**: Full system integration working

## FINAL TARGET ARCHITECTURE (Week 10)

**6 Core Services**:
1. **api-gateway** (Go) - Single entry point, routing
2. **platform-core-service** (Go) - Auth, users, permissions
3. **data-integration-service** (Python) - Airtable, external APIs
4. **ai-processing-service** (Python) - LLM, embeddings, AI
5. **workflow-service** (Python) - Automation, business logic
6. **communication-service** (Go) - Notifications, webhooks

**Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Monitoring Stack

## SUCCESS CRITERIA & CHECKPOINTS

### Sprint Go/No-Go Criteria:
Each sprint requires:
- [ ] Target services merged successfully
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance baselines maintained

- **System Availability**: >99.5%

## RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Items:
1. **Python Import Path Issues**: Fix in Week 1 during stabilization
2. **Service Dependencies**: Map and eliminate during consolidation
3. **Database Schema Changes**: Minimal changes, backward compatible
4. **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking

### Rollback Strategy:
- Tagged releases at each consolidation step
- Database migration scripts with rollback
- Feature flags for service switching
- 24-hour rollback window for each sprint

### Emergency Procedures:
- **Red Alert**: Immediate rollback to last known good state
- **Yellow Alert**: Pause consolidation, stabilize current state
- **Green Light**: Proceed to next sprint

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Team Composition:
- 1x Delivery Manager (oversight, coordination)
- 2x Senior Backend Engineers (Go + Python expertise)
- 1x DevOps Engineer (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
- 1x QA Engineer (testing, validation)

### Time Allocation:
- **Week 1**: 100% focus on immediate wins
- **Week 2**: Foundation building
- **Weeks 3-10**: Sprint execution with daily standups

## COMMUNICATION PLAN

### Daily:
- Stand-up at 9 AM with progress updates
- End-of-day status report to stakeholders
- Immediate escalation for blockers

### Weekly:
- Sprint demo to stakeholders
- Go/No-Go decision meeting
- Risk assessment and mitigation review

### Emergency:
- Incident response team activation
- Stakeholder notification within 1 hour
- Recovery plan execution

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate Actions (Today)**:
1. [ ] Get team approval for this plan
2. [ ] Set up daily standups starting tomorrow
3. [ ] Begin Week 1 Quick Win #1: Service health fixes
4. [ ] Schedule go/no-go checkpoint for end of Week 1

**Critical Path**:
Week 1 success is MANDATORY. Without credible quick wins, the 8-week program will lose stakeholder support and fail.

**Success depends on**: Ruthless focus on achievable goals, no scope creep, daily progress tracking, and immediate course correction when needed.
