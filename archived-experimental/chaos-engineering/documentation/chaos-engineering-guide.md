# PyAirtable Chaos Engineering Guide

## Introduction

Chaos Engineering is the practice of intentionally injecting failures into our systems to test their resilience and identify weaknesses before they cause outages in production. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for conducting chaos experiments on the PyAirtable platform.

## Philosophy

### Principles of Chaos Engineering

1. **Build a hypothesis around steady-state behavior**
2. **Vary real-world events** 
3. **Run experiments in production** (or production-like environments)
4. **Automate experiments to run continuously**
5. **Minimize blast radius**

### PyAirtable Specific Goals

- Validate circuit breaker implementations
- Test service resilience and recovery
- Verify monitoring and alerting systems
- Improve incident response procedures
- Build confidence in system reliability

   ```bash
   ./health-check.sh pre
   ```

2. **Team Notification**
   - Notify relevant teams
   - Set expectations for potential alerts
   - Ensure on-call coverage

3. **Baseline Metrics**
   - Record normal response times
   - Note current error rates
   - Document resource utilization

### Phase 2: Experiment Execution

1. **Start Monitoring**
   ```bash
   ./monitor-experiment.sh <experiment-name> <duration>
   ```

2. **Observe System Behavior**
   - Monitor Grafana dashboards
   - Watch for unexpected failures
   - Track recovery patterns

3. **Document Observations**
   - Record timeline of events
   - Note any manual interventions
   - Capture metric anomalies

### Phase 3: Post-Experiment

1. **System Recovery Validation**
   ```bash
   ./health-check.sh post
   ```

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Review response time impacts
   - Analyze error rate patterns
   - Assess recovery times

3. **Documentation**
   - Update runbooks with learnings
   - Record any system improvements needed
   - Share results with teams

## Safety Measures

### Automated Safeguards

1. **Guardrails Controller**
   - Enforces experiment limits
   - Prevents dangerous experiments
   - Auto-stops on critical failures

2. **Emergency Stop**
   ```bash
   # Immediate halt of all experiments
   cd ../safety
   ./emergency-stop.sh
   ```

3. **Monitoring Thresholds**
   - Service availability < 60%
   - Error rate > 10 req/sec
   - Response time P95 > 10s

### Manual Safety Procedures

1. **Pre-experiment Checklist**
   - [ ] All services healthy
   - [ ] Monitoring systems operational
   - [ ] Team notified and available
   - [ ] Emergency procedures reviewed

2. **During Experiment**
   - Monitor dashboards continuously
   - Be ready to trigger emergency stop
   - Document unexpected behaviors
   - Coordinate with other teams

3. **Emergency Protocols**
   - Stop all chaos experiments immediately
   - Restart affected services
   - Notify incident management
   - Conduct post-incident review

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Critical Metrics

1. **Service Availability**
   ```promql
   avg by (service) (up{job="pyairtable-services"})
   ```

2. **Response Times**
   ```promql
   histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
   ```

3. **Error Rates**
   ```promql
   rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])
   ```

4. **Pod Restart Rate**
   ```promql
   rate(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[5m])
   ```

## Best Practices

### Experiment Design

1. **Start Small**: Begin with low-impact experiments
2. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Define expected outcomes before starting
3. **Measurable**: Use concrete metrics to evaluate results
4. **Reversible**: Ensure experiments can be stopped quickly
5. **Documented**: Record all procedures and observations

### Execution Guidelines

1. **Business Hours**: Run experiments during business hours when teams are available
2. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase experiment complexity and impact
3. **Team Coordination**: Ensure all relevant teams are aware and prepared
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system behavior during experiments
5. **Learning Focus**: Prioritize learning over proving system reliability

### Results Analysis

1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Use metrics to measure impact objectively
2. **Qualitative Observations**: Record behavioral patterns and team responses
3. **Comparison**: Compare results against baseline measurements
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track improvements over time
5. **Action Items**: Convert learnings into concrete improvements

## Common Failure Patterns

### 1. Cascading Failures

**Description**: One service failure causes dependent services to fail
**Detection**: Multiple service alerts in quick succession
**Prevention**: Implement circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns

### 2. Resource Exhaustion

**Description**: Services consume all available CPU/memory/disk
**Detection**: High resource utilization metrics
**Prevention**: Set proper resource limits and implement backpressure

### 3. Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Description**: Database/cache connection pools become exhausted
**Detection**: Connection timeout errors
**Prevention**: Proper connection pool sizing and monitoring

### 4. Thundering Herd

**Description**: All clients retry simultaneously after a failure
**Detection**: Sudden spike in requests after service recovery  
**Prevention**: Implement jittered exponential backoff

## Improvement Tracking

### Resilience Metrics

Track these metrics over time to measure system improvement:

1. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
2. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**  
3. **Service Availability Percentage**
4. **Experiment Success Rate**
5. **Manual Intervention Frequency**

### Quarterly Reviews

1. **Experiment Results Summary**
2. **System Improvements Implemented**
3. **New Vulnerabilities Discovered**
4. **Process Improvements**
5. **Team Capability Development**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Experiments Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check Chaos Mesh installation
   kubectl get pods -n chaos-engineering
   
   # Verify RBAC permissions
   kubectl auth can-i create podchaos --as=system:serviceaccount:chaos-engineering:chaos-engineering-sa
   ```

2. **Services Don't Recover**
   ```bash
   # Force emergency stop
   ./safety/emergency-stop.sh
   
   # Check for resource constraints
   kubectl describe nodes
   kubectl top pods -n pyairtable
   ```

3. **Monitoring Not Working**
   ```bash
   # Check Prometheus targets
   kubectl port-forward svc/chaos-prometheus 9090:9090 -n chaos-engineering
   # Open http://localhost:9090/targets
   
   # Verify Grafana datasources
   kubectl port-forward svc/chaos-grafana 3000:3000 -n chaos-engineering
   ```

## Compliance and Governance

### Approval Process

1. **Experiment Proposals**: Document experiment goals and procedures

## Conclusion

Chaos engineering is an ongoing practice that helps build more resilient systems. By systematically testing our systems' failure modes, we can identify and fix weaknesses before they impact users. This guide provides the foundation for conducting safe, effective chaos experiments on the PyAirtable platform.

Remember: The goal is not to break things, but to learn how to make them more reliable.
