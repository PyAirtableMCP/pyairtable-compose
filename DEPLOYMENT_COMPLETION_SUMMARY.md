### Container Images
All services publish container images to:
```
ghcr.io/pyairtablemcp/[service-name]:latest
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Configure Production Secrets**: Set up GitHub secrets for database credentials, API keys, and JWT secrets
2. **Set up Environments**: Create staging and production environment configurations
3. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Set up Kubernetes cluster or Docker Swarm for deployment
4. **Configure Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting systems

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
1. **Implement Service Logic**: Complete the business logic for each consolidated service
2. **Integration Testing**: Set up end-to-end testing between services
3. **Load Testing**: Perform performance testing and optimization
4. **Documentation Updates**: Add API documentation and integration guides

### Long-term (Low Priority)
1. **Service Mesh**: Consider Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management
2. **GitOps**: Implement ArgoCD or Flux for declarative deployments
3. **Multi-region**: Plan for multi-region deployment strategy
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Implement backup and recovery procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- **Private repositories** with organization-level access control
- **Comprehensive security scanning** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Container security** with non-root users and minimal images
- **Secrets management** ready for production deployment
- **Regular security updates** through automated dependency management

### Recommended Additional Measures
- **Secrets management** system (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
