‚Ä¢ NO PRs merged without explicit Product Manager approval
‚Ä¢ Daily 9 AM migration standups - attendance MANDATORY

üéØ YOUR ROLE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS:
1. STOP all current work immediately
2. Join emergency all-hands meeting at [TIME] in [LOCATION/ZOOM]
3. Review emergency migration plan (link attached)

Leadership Team,

CRITICAL SITUATION REQUIRING IMMEDIATE DECISION

Our technical audit has revealed catastrophic architectural issues that pose immediate project failure risk.

üìä BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
‚Ä¢ Project failure probability: 90% without immediate intervention
‚Ä¢ Current feature delivery capability: 0% (development effectively stopped)
‚Ä¢ Financial impact: Complete loss of development investment (~$X spent to date)
‚Ä¢ Timeline risk: 3-6 month delay if not addressed in next 4 weeks
‚Ä¢ Competitive risk: Major advantage loss to competitors

üö® ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Hybrid monorepo architecture with 73,547 conflicting files
‚Ä¢ 19+ duplicate repositories causing massive maintenance overhead
‚Ä¢ Multiple deployment strategies creating infrastructure chaos
‚Ä¢ Pending 100k+ line PR that could break entire system

üí° EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:
‚Ä¢ 4-week surgical migration to extract critical services
‚Ä¢ Complete feature freeze to focus all resources on migration
‚Ä¢ Daily executive briefings with clear success metrics
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive rollback procedures if migration fails
‚Ä¢ Estimated resource cost: 4 weeks vs. complete project loss

‚úÖ DELIVERABLES READY:
‚Ä¢ Detailed migration roadmap with daily milestones
‚Ä¢ Risk mitigation strategies with automated rollback procedures
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder communication plan with daily progress updates
‚Ä¢ Business continuity plan to restore feature delivery in Week 8

üî¥ DECISIONS NEEDED (Within 2 hours):
1. Approve emergency migration plan and feature freeze
2. Authorize additional budget for potential rollback procedures (~$X)
3. Approve communication to customers about temporary feature freeze
4. Designate executive sponsor for daily migration oversight

This is our most critical business decision. Without immediate action, we lose everything.
