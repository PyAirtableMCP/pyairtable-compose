# PyAirtable Agile Development Workflow Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the agile development workflow for the PyAirtable application transformation project. We're using a 3-sprint, 6-week timeline to move from a broken application state to production-ready deployment.

## Sprint Structure
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks each
- **Total Timeline**: 6 weeks
- **Sprint Planning**: Beginning of each sprint
- **Sprint Review**: End of each sprint
- **Daily Standups**: Every working day
- **Retrospectives**: End of each sprint

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Scrum Master
- Facilitate all scrum ceremonies
- Remove impediments and blockers
- Ensure team follows agile practices
- Monitor sprint progress and velocity

### Product Owner
- Define acceptance criteria for user stories
- Prioritize backlog items
- Accept completed work
- Communicate with stakeholders

### Development Team
- Estimate story points for backlog items
- Commit to sprint deliverables
- Collaborate on technical implementation
- Maintain code quality and testing standards

## Issue Management System

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Blocking issues that prevent core functionality
- **P1 (High)**: Important features that significantly impact user experience
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice-to-have features and improvements

### Story Point Estimation
- **1-3 points**: Small tasks, single developer, less than 1 day
- **5 points**: Medium tasks, single developer, 1-2 days
- **8 points**: Large tasks, single developer, 3-5 days or requires collaboration
- **13 points**: Very large tasks, multiple developers, full sprint effort
- **21 points**: Epic-level work that should be broken down further

### Issue Labels
- `P0`, `P1`, `P2` for priority
- `sprint1`, `sprint2`, `sprint3` for sprint assignment
- `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement` for issue type
- `frontend`, `backend`, `infrastructure`, `testing` for components
- `blocked`, `in-progress`, `review`, `ready-to-deploy` for status

## Branch Management Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feat/[feature-name]          # New features
fix/[issue-description]      # Bug fixes
perf/[optimization-area]     # Performance improvements
security/[security-aspect]   # Security related changes
docs/[documentation-type]    # Documentation updates
refactor/[component-name]    # Code refactoring
test/[test-area]            # Testing improvements
```

### Git Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: Branch from `main` for each story
2. **Development**: Make commits with clear, descriptive messages
3. **Pull Request**: Create PR when ready for review
4. **Review Process**: Minimum 2 approvals required
5. **Merge**: Squash and merge to maintain clean history
6. **Cleanup**: Delete feature branch after merge

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issue numbers with #123

Closes #123
```

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning (4 hours at start of sprint)
**Agenda:**

2. Present sprint goal and priorities
3. Story estimation and commitment
4. Task breakdown and assignment
5. Identify dependencies and risks

**Deliverables:**
- Sprint backlog with committed stories
- Sprint goal statement
- Risk and dependency register
- Team capacity and availability

### Daily Standups (15 minutes daily)
**Format:**
