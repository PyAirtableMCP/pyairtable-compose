# PyAirtableMCP Repository Cleanup & Organization Spike Plan

**Created:** August 10, 2025  
**Author:** Claude (Product Manager)  
**Sprint:** Repository Cleanup & Organization  
**Epic:** PyAirtableMCP Infrastructure Consolidation

---

## Executive Summary

Based on architectural analysis, the PyAirtableMCP organization currently has:
- **5 existing repositories** in various states
- **9 missing core service repositories** that need extraction/migration
- **1 cleaned reference repository** (pyairtable-compose: 6.4GB → 716MB)
- **Significant duplication** and inconsistent naming across the ecosystem

This spike plan addresses the complete reorganization into a proper microservices architecture with clear service boundaries, consistent naming, and proper documentation.

## 🚀 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1 - Can Run in Parallel:**
- Spike 1.1 (API Gateway) - Independent
- Spike 1.2 (Auth Service) - Independent  
- Spike 1.3 (Airtable Gateway) - Independent

**Phase 1 - Must Run Sequentially:**
- Spike 1.4 (LLM Orchestrator) - After Spike 1.3
- Spike 1.5 (MCP Server) - After Spike 1.4

**Phase 2 - Sequential Dependencies:**
- Spike 2.1 requires Spikes 1.1, 1.2
- Spike 2.2 requires Spike 2.1, 1.3

**Phase 3 - Dependent on Backend:**
- Both frontend spikes require all backend services complete

### Resource Allocation

**Total Estimated Effort:**
- **Story Points:** 105 points
- **Claude Sessions:** 26 sessions
- **Timeline:** 8-10 weeks (assuming 3-4 sessions per week)

**Critical Path Analysis:**
1. Airtable Gateway (13 pts) → LLM Orchestrator (13 pts) → Frontend (13 pts)
2. Total Critical Path: 39 story points (37% of total effort)

### Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Spikes:**
1. **Spike 1.3 (Airtable Gateway)** - API integration complexity
2. **Spike 1.4 (LLM Orchestrator)** - Multi-provider complexity
3. **Spike 3.1 (Frontend)** - Integration with all services

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start high-risk spikes early
- Create proof-of-concept prototypes first
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Plan for additional story points if needed
