As a user, I need to successfully authenticate so I can access the PyAirtable features.

## Current State
- Frontend login form exists but doesn't connect to backend
- Authentication service running on port 7007 but not properly integrated
- JWT token generation/validation not working end-to-end
- CORS issues preventing frontend-backend communication

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Frontend login form connects to backend auth service on port 7007
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Session management working between frontend (port 5173) and backend
- [ ] Error handling for invalid credentials with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism prevents session expiration
- [ ] CORS configuration allows frontend-backend communication

## Branch Name
\`fix/authentication-flow\`

## Story Points
8 (Complex integration between frontend and backend)
