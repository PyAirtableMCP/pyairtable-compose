## 🚦 **Recommended Merge Strategy**

### 🎯 **Option 1: Fix-First Approach** (RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours additional work

**Required Fixes Before Merge**:
1. ✅ **Workspace Service Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Debug workspace service connectivity
   docker-compose logs workspace-service
   # Check port conflicts and configuration
   # Verify database migrations and dependencies
   ```

2. ✅ **Authentication Flow Repair**
   ```bash
   # Debug login endpoint issues
   # Verify JWT token generation/validation
   # Test user session management
   ```

3. ✅ **Database Connection Stabilization**
   ```bash
   # Fix test database configuration
   # Verify PostgreSQL connection pooling
   # Update connection strings and credentials
   ```

### 🎯 **Option 2: Merge-with-Follow-ups** (ALTERNATIVE)
**Timeline**: Immediate merge, fixes in Sprint 5

**Pros**:
- Immediately captures 82k line cleanup
- Enables parallel development on Sprint 5
- Preserves Sprint 4 momentum

**Cons**:
