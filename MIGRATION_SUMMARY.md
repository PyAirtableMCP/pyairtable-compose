## 🔗 Python-Go Interoperability

### 1. HTTP API Bridge
```go
// Go service calls Python AI service
func (g *Gateway) callLLMService(prompt string) (*AIResponse, error) {
    resp, err := g.httpClient.Post(
        g.config.LLMOrchestratorURL+"/generate",
        "application/json",
        bytes.NewBuffer(jsonData),
    )
    // Handle response...
}
```

### 2. Shared Database Patterns
```go
// Go and Python share PostgreSQL tables
type User struct {
    ID        uint      `gorm:"primaryKey" json:"id"`
    Email     string    `gorm:"unique;not null" json:"email"`
    CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

### 3. Message Queue Integration
- **NSQ/Redis**: Event-driven communication between Go and Python
- **JSON Protocol**: Language-agnostic message format
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance for cross-service calls
