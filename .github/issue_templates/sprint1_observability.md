# P0-S1-003: Deploy Observability Stack

## User Story
**As an** operations team member  
**I need** monitoring and logging  
**So that** I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health

## Current State
- Observability stack is offline
- No centralized logging or metrics collection
- Service health monitoring not functional
- Debugging requires manual log inspection
- No alerting for system failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection for all 8 services
- [ ] Grafana dashboards showing service health and performance
- [ ] Loki log aggregation collecting logs from all services
- [ ] Jaeger distributed tracing for request flow visualization
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented for all services
- [ ] Alert rules configured for critical failures
- [ ] Service discovery working for dynamic service monitoring
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Documentation for using monitoring tools

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Prometheus Setup
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus server via docker-compose
- [ ] Configure service discovery for all 8 services
- [ ] Add `/metrics` endpoints to each service
- [ ] Configure scraping intervals and retention
- [ ] Set up recording rules for common queries

### Grafana Configuration
- [ ] Deploy Grafana with persistent storage
- [ ] Create datasource configurations for Prometheus and Loki
- [ ] Build service overview dashboard
- [ ] Create individual service dashboards
- [ ] Set up business metrics dashboards
- [ ] Configure dashboard templates for new services

### Loki Log Aggregation
- [ ] Deploy Loki for log storage and querying
- [ ] Configure log forwarding from all services
- [ ] Implement structured logging across services
- [ ] Set up log retention policies
- [ ] Add log parsing and labeling rules

### Jaeger Tracing
- [ ] Deploy Jaeger for distributed tracing
- [ ] Add tracing instrumentation to services
- [ ] Configure sampling rates
- [ ] Set up trace correlation across services

### Service Health Endpoints
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for API Gateway
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for Frontend service
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for LLM Orchestrator
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for MCP Server
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for Airtable Gateway
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for Platform Services
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for Automation Services
- [ ] Implement `/health` endpoint for SAGA Orchestrator

### Alerting Rules
- [ ] Service down alerts
- [ ] High error rate alerts
- [ ] High response time alerts
- [ ] Database connection failure alerts
- [ ] Redis connection failure alerts
- [ ] Disk space alerts
- [ ] Memory usage alerts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) deployed and functional
- [ ] All services exposing metrics and health endpoints
- [ ] Dashboards showing real-time service status
- [ ] Log aggregation working for all services
- [ ] Basic alerting rules configured and tested
- [ ] Documentation for monitoring setup complete
- [ ] Team trained on using monitoring tools
- [ ] Performance baselines documented

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Health endpoints return proper status codes
- [ ] Metrics are being collected from all services
- [ ] Logs are being aggregated properly
- [ ] Traces can be viewed for request flows
- [ ] Alerts fire when conditions are met
- [ ] Dashboards display accurate data

## Branch Name
`feat/observability-stack`

## Story Points
**10** (Medium-high complexity involving multiple monitoring tools and service instrumentation)

## Dependencies
- All services must be running and accessible
- Docker compose configuration access
- Network access between monitoring components and services

## Service-Specific Tasks

### API Gateway (Port 7000)
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics middleware
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint
- [ ] Add request tracing headers
- [ ] Configure structured logging

### Frontend (Port 5173)
- [ ] Add client-side error reporting
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Add user experience metrics

### LLM Orchestrator (Port 7003)
- [ ] Add LLM request/response metrics
- [ ] Monitor token usage and costs
- [ ] Track response times and failures

### MCP Server (Port 7001)
- [ ] Monitor tool execution metrics
- [ ] Track tool success/failure rates
- [ ] Add performance metrics for tools

### Airtable Gateway (Port 7002)
- [ ] Monitor API rate limiting
- [ ] Track Airtable request metrics
- [ ] Add connection pool monitoring

### Platform Services (Port 7007)
- [ ] Monitor authentication metrics
- [ ] Track user activity analytics
- [ ] Add database query performance metrics

### Automation Services (Port 7006)
- [ ] Monitor file processing metrics
- [ ] Track workflow execution status
- [ ] Add queue depth monitoring

### SAGA Orchestrator (Port 7008)
- [ ] Monitor transaction success rates
- [ ] Track distributed transaction metrics
- [ ] Add compensation action monitoring

## Risk Factors
- Performance impact of monitoring on services
- Storage requirements for logs and metrics
- Network overhead from metrics collection
- Complexity of distributed tracing setup

## Additional Context
This observability infrastructure is critical for maintaining the 8-service architecture. Without proper monitoring, debugging issues across the microservices becomes extremely difficult.
