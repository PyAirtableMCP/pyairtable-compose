# P0-S1-001: Fix End-to-End Authentication Flow

## User Story
**As a** user  
**I need** to successfully authenticate  
**So that** I can access the PyAirtable features

## Current State
- Frontend login form exists but doesn't connect to backend
- Authentication service running on port 7007 but not properly integrated
- JWT token generation/validation not working end-to-end
- CORS issues preventing frontend-backend communication

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Frontend login form connects to backend auth service on port 7007
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Session management working between frontend (port 5173) and backend
- [ ] Error handling for invalid credentials with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism prevents session expiration
- [ ] CORS configuration allows frontend-backend communication

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Fix auth service configuration in docker-compose
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation endpoint `/api/auth/login`
- [ ] Implement token validation middleware
- [ ] Add token refresh endpoint `/api/auth/refresh`
- [ ] Configure CORS to allow requests from port 5173
- [ ] Add proper error responses for authentication failures

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Update API client to use correct auth endpoints (port 7007)
- [ ] Implement token storage in localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] Add authentication context to React app
- [ ] Create protected route component
- [ ] Add token refresh logic before API calls
- [ ] Implement logout functionality

### Configuration Tasks
- [ ] Update docker-compose service configurations
- [ ] Set proper environment variables for JWT secret
- [ ] Configure nginx/proxy settings if needed

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User can successfully log in through frontend
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated and stored securely
- [ ] Protected pages require authentication
- [ ] Token refresh works automatically
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication data
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified through testing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Integration tests pass

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication service
- [ ] Frontend component tests for login form
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] E2E tests for complete login/logout cycle

## Branch Name
`fix/authentication-flow`

## Story Points
**8** (Complex integration between frontend and backend with multiple moving parts)

## Dependencies
- Platform services must be running and healthy
- Database connection for user storage
- Redis for session management

## Risk Factors
- CORS configuration complexity
- Token security implementation
- Session management across services

## Additional Context
This is a critical P0 issue blocking all user functionality. Without working authentication, no other features can be properly tested or used.
