# P0-S1-002: Establish Test Infrastructure

## User Story
**As a** developer  
**I need** a working test suite  
**So that** I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions

## Current State
- Test suite shows 0-8 out of 42 tests passing
- Multiple testing frameworks partially configured
- No consistent testing strategy across services
- CI/CD pipeline not running tests automatically
- Test databases not properly configured

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test framework setup for all Python services (pytest)
- [ ] Unit test framework setup for Go services
- [ ] Frontend testing setup with React Testing Library/Vitest
- [ ] Integration tests for critical API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Test database isolation and cleanup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests automatically
- [ ] At least 50% of existing tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage reporting enabled
- [ ] Test documentation and guidelines created

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Python Services Testing
- [ ] Configure pytest for each service
- [ ] Set up test database configuration
- [ ] Create conftest.py for shared fixtures
- [ ] Add factory patterns for test data
- [ ] Implement service mocking for unit tests

### Go Services Testing
- [ ] Set up Go testing framework
- [ ] Configure test database connections
- [ ] Add test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Implement table-driven tests

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Configure Vitest for React components
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library
- [ ] Add component test examples
- [ ] Configure test environment variables
- [ ] Set up MSW for API mocking

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Docker compose test configuration
- [ ] Database test fixtures and cleanup
- [ ] Service-to-service communication tests
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Test result reporting
- [ ] Coverage reporting integration
- [ ] Automated test runs on PR creation

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Test database setup and teardown
- [ ] Redis test configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management for tests
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test frameworks properly configured and working
- [ ] Test databases isolated and properly managed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests on every PR
- [ ] At least 50% of tests passing consistently
- [ ] Test coverage reports generated
- [ ] Documentation for adding new tests created
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Team trained on testing practices

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for critical business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Component tests for React components
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Performance tests for key operations

## Branch Name
`feat/test-infrastructure`

## Story Points
**13** (Large effort involving multiple services, frameworks, and infrastructure setup)

## Dependencies
- Database services must be running
- All services must be buildable and startable
- CI/CD pipeline access and configuration

## Risk Factors
- Complex test environment setup
- Service dependencies in tests
- Test data management complexity
- CI/CD pipeline configuration challenges

## Subtasks Breakdown
1. **Week 1**: Python service testing setup (5 points)
2. **Week 1**: Frontend testing configuration (3 points)
3. **Week 2**: Integration testing framework (3 points)
4. **Week 2**: CI/CD integration and documentation (2 points)

## Additional Context
This is critical infrastructure work that will enable reliable development and deployment. The current state of 0-8 passing tests out of 42 indicates fundamental issues that must be resolved before any other development can proceed safely.
