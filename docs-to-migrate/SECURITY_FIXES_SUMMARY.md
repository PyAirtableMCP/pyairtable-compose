# SCRUM-15 Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Input Validation in Registration Handler (Line 35)
**Fixed by:**
- Implemented comprehensive validation using `go-playground/validator/v10`
- Added custom validation rules for secure email, strong password, and safe string validation
- Created `internal/validation/validator.go` with advanced security checks
- Added XSS protection using `bluemonday` sanitizer
- Enhanced email validation with RFC 5321 compliance and security pattern detection
- Password strength validation with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters requirements

**Security Improvements:**
- Email format validation with length limits and XSS protection
- Strong password requirements preventing common weak patterns
- Input sanitization preventing script injection attacks
- Name field validation allowing only safe characters

### 2. ✅ Incomplete GetMe and UpdateMe Endpoints (Lines 144-165)
**Fixed by:**
- Completed both endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- Added proper null/not found checks for users
- Enhanced logging for security monitoring
- Added validation for profile update requests
- Implemented safe name validation and sanitization

**Security Improvements:**
- Proper authorization checks with detailed logging
- Safe type assertions with ok checks
- Input validation for all profile update fields
- Comprehensive error responses without information leakage

### 3. ✅ Type Assertion Safety Issues (Lines 196-202)
**Fixed by:**
- Replaced unsafe type assertions with safe assertions using ok checks
- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid token claims
- Enhanced JWT claim validation with type safety
- Implemented proper error responses for invalid tokens

**Security Improvements:**
- Prevents runtime panics from malformed JWT tokens
- Safe extraction of all JWT claims with validation
- Proper error handling for token manipulation attempts

## Additional Security Enhancements

### 4. ✅ Rate Limiting Protection
**Implemented:**
- In-memory rate limiter with configurable limits
- 5 requests per minute for auth endpoints (login/register)
- 10 requests per minute for general endpoints
- IP-based tracking with User-Agent consideration for auth endpoints
- Automatic cleanup of old rate limit entries

### 5. ✅ Security Headers Middleware
**Added:**
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevent MIME sniffing)
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content Security Policy with strict rules
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection

### 6. ✅ Request Size Limits
**Implemented:**
- 1MB body limit to prevent DoS attacks
- Input size validation middleware
- Proper error handling for oversized requests

### 7. ✅ Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
**Added:**
- Security-focused logging with IP tracking
- User agent logging for suspicious activity detection
- Structured logging for all authentication events
- Error context preservation without information leakage

## Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Security Test Suite
Created `test_security_fixes.go` with tests for:
- Email validation with XSS attempt detection
- Password strength validation with various attack patterns  
- Name field sanitization and XSS protection
- Struct validation using custom validation rules
- Login validation with malicious input detection

**Test Results:** ✅ All security validations working correctly

## Dependencies Added

- `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` - Advanced input validation
- `github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday` - XSS protection and HTML sanitization

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `go.mod` - Added security dependencies
- `internal/handlers/auth.go` - Enhanced all handlers with validation
- `internal/services/auth.go` - Fixed type assertions
- `internal/models/user.go` - Added validation tags
- `cmd/auth-service/main.go` - Added security middleware

### New Files:
- `internal/validation/validator.go` - Custom validation service
- `internal/middleware/security.go` - Security middleware
- `test_security_fixes.go` - Comprehensive security tests

## Security Compliance

✅ **Input Validation:** All user inputs validated and sanitized  
✅ **XSS Protection:** HTML sanitization and safe string validation  
✅ **Brute Force Protection:** Rate limiting on authentication endpoints  
✅ **Type Safety:** Safe type assertions preventing runtime panics  
✅ **Information Leakage:** Proper error responses without sensitive data  
✅ **Security Headers:** Comprehensive protection headers implemented  
✅ **Password Security:** Strong password requirements enforced  
✅ **Email Security:** RFC-compliant validation with attack pattern detection  

## Production Readiness Assessment

The authentication system is now **production-ready** with:
- ✅ Enterprise-grade input validation
- ✅ Advanced security middleware
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
