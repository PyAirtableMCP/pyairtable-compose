# Expert Agent Meeting: PyAirtable Progress Review
## Meeting Date: August 8, 2025
## Meeting Type: Cross-functional Architecture & Progress Assessment

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Meeting Outcome:** CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED - System not ready for production despite claimed 65% completion rate. Actual operational services: 62.5% (5/8), with 37.5% service failures blocking core functionality.
