## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### PRIMARY ISSUES

#### 1. **Docker Build/Dependency Failures** 🚨
```
ERROR: ../pyairtable-common is not a valid editable requirement
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'telemetry'
```

#### 2. **Missing Environment Variables** 🚨
```
REDIS_PASSWORD environment variable not passed to containers
OpenTelemetry initialization failed: No module named 'telemetry'
```

#### 3. **Service Orchestration Breakdown** 🚨
- Services failing health checks due to missing dependencies
- Startup sequence not enforcing proper dependency order
- No graceful degradation or error handling

#### 4. **Frontend Routing Issues** 🚨
```
404: This page could not be found
Next.js routing errors for auth flows
```

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### PHASE 1: Emergency Infrastructure Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### Task 1: Fix Docker Build Dependencies 
**Agent: Infrastructure Engineer**
```bash
1. Fix pyairtable-common dependency path in MCP server
2. Add missing config and telemetry modules to airtable-gateway
3. Rebuild all Python service images with proper dependencies
4. Validate all Docker builds complete successfully
```

#### Task 2: Fix Environment Variable Propagation
**Agent: DevOps Engineer**
```bash
1. Add REDIS_PASSWORD to Redis container environment
2. Validate all required env vars are propagated to containers
3. Test environment variable loading in all services
4. Fix health check authentication issues
```

#### Task 3: Implement Service Dependency Management
**Agent: System Architect**
```bash
1. Fix startup orchestrator variable scoping issues
2. Implement proper dependency health checks
3. Add service readiness probes with authentication
4. Create graceful startup sequence with proper timing
```

#### Task 4: Fix Frontend Routing and Authentication
**Agent: Frontend Developer**
```bash
1. Fix Next.js routing configuration for auth pages
2. Implement proper error handling for missing pages
3. Connect frontend auth flow to backend services
4. Test all frontend routes and API integration
```

### PHASE 2: Service Integration Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

#### Task 5: Implement Missing API Endpoints
**Agent: Backend Developer**
```bash
1. Implement all authentication endpoints (register, login, validate)
2. Implement Airtable CRUD operations endpoints
3. Implement workflow management endpoints
4. Implement file operations endpoints
5. Implement SAGA transaction endpoints
```

#### Task 6: Performance Optimization
**Agent: Performance Engineer**
```bash
1. Optimize service response times (current: 5026ms avg)
2. Implement proper connection pooling
3. Add caching layers for frequent operations
4. Optimize database queries and connection handling
```

### PHASE 3: Monitoring and Observability (Priority: MEDIUM)
