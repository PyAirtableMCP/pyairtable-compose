## 2. Authentication & Authorization Assessment

### 2.1 Current Implementation ✅
**Strengths:**
- **JWT-based authentication** with HS256 algorithm enforcement
- **Algorithm confusion attack prevention** - explicitly validates HS256
- **Timing attack resistance** - constant-time API key comparison
- **Token refresh mechanism** with rotation and blacklisting
- **Centralized auth service** (Go-based, port 8081)

**Configuration Analysis:**
```go
// Secure JWT validation implementation found
if token.Method != jwt.SigningMethodHS256 {
    return nil, errors.New("unexpected signing method: only HS256 allowed")
}

// Constant-time API key comparison
if subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(key), []byte(apiKey)) != 1 {
    return c.Status(401).JSON(fiber.Map{"error": "Invalid API key"})
}
```

### 2.2 Authorization Gaps ⚠️
**Critical Issues:**
1. **Missing RBAC implementation** across services
2. **No centralized permission service** integration
3. **Basic API key validation** without scope restrictions
4. **Limited multi-tenant authorization** controls

**Risk Level:** HIGH

---

## 3. Data Encryption Analysis

### 3.1 Encryption Implementation ✅
**Excellent Implementation:**
- **Database SSL/TLS:** All connections use `sslmode=require`
- **Redis TLS:** Authentication and encryption enabled
- **Inter-service communication:** HTTPS enforced
- **JWT tokens:** Cryptographically signed with secure secrets

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# Secure database configuration found
DATABASE_URL: "postgres://admin:changeme@postgres:5432/pyairtable?sslmode=require"
REDIS_URL: "redis://:changeme@redis:6379/0"
```

### 3.2 Encryption at Rest
**Current State:** GOOD
- Database encryption depends on PostgreSQL configuration
- Redis persistence encryption available
- **Recommendation:** Implement application-level field encryption for PII

---

## 4. Service-to-Service Security

### 4.1 Current Architecture ⚠️
**Findings:**
- **HTTP-based communication** between services
- **API key authentication** for service-to-service calls
- **No mutual TLS (mTLS)** implementation
- **Service mesh** configuration present but not fully deployed

### 4.2 Zero-Trust Implementation Gap
**Critical Security Gap:**
- Services assume network-level trust
- No certificate-based service identity verification
- Missing service-to-service authorization policies

**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Impact:** Lateral movement in case of service compromise

---

## 5. Secret Management Evaluation

### 5.1 Current Approach ⚠️
**Weaknesses Identified:**
```bash
# Hardcoded defaults found in configuration
JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET:-your-secret-key-here}
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
REDIS_PASSWORD: ${REDIS_PASSWORD:-changeme}
```

**Issues:**
1. **Environment variable-based** secret storage
2. **No centralized secret rotation**
3. **Weak default passwords** in development
4. **No enterprise vault integration** (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

**Risk Level:** HIGH

### 5.2 Recommendations
1. Implement HashiCorp Vault integration
2. Automated secret rotation policies
3. Remove all default passwords
4. Certificate-based authentication for critical services

---

## 6. API Security & Rate Limiting

### 6.1 Current Implementation
**Partial Implementation:**
- Basic rate limiting middleware present
- API key validation implemented
- Security headers configured

**Gaps:**
```go
// Rate limiting not consistently applied across services
// Missing per-endpoint rate limiting
// No distributed rate limiting with Redis
```

### 6.2 Missing Controls
1. **Advanced rate limiting** per user/API key
2. **Request size limits** and payload validation
3. **API versioning security** controls
4. **GraphQL query complexity** limits (for GraphQL services)

---

## 7. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

### 7.1 Architecture Analysis ⚠️
**Critical Gap:** Limited tenant isolation implementation

**Findings:**
- Tenant service exists (port 8083) but basic implementation
- **No row-level security (RLS)** in database
- **Shared database instances** across tenants
- **Missing tenant-scoped authorization** policies

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL for SaaS deployment

### 7.2 GDPR/Privacy Compliance Impact
**Compliance Risks:**
- Cross-tenant data leakage potential
- Insufficient data segregation
- Missing data anonymization capabilities

---

## 8. Container & Kubernetes Security

### 8.1 Container Security ✅
**Strong Implementation:**
- **Trivy vulnerability scanning** implemented
- **Non-root user containers** configured
- **Security context** properly set
- **Image signing** and verification

### 8.2 Kubernetes Security
**Good Foundation:**
```yaml
# Security contexts found in deployments
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Pod Security Standards enforcement
- Network policies for micro-segmentation
- Service account privilege minimization

---

## 9. Monitoring & Incident Response

### 9.1 Security Monitoring ✅
**Excellent Implementation:**
- **Centralized audit logging** with tamper protection
- **SIEM integration** (Elasticsearch, Splunk, Sumo Logic)
- **Real-time security metrics** collection
- **Automated threat detection** capabilities

**Evidence:**
```go
// Comprehensive audit logging found
type AuditEvent struct {
    ID        string    `json:"id"`
    Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
    UserID    string    `json:"user_id,omitempty"`
    Action    string    `json:"action"`
    Resource  string    `json:"resource"`
    // HMAC for tamper protection
    Signature string    `json:"signature"`
}
```

### 9.2 Incident Response
