## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Status: **NOT READY** ‚ùå

**Assessment:** System has critical issues that must be resolved before production deployment.

### Critical Blockers
1. **Authentication Failure (Priority 1):**
   - Login/registration endpoints returning errors
   - No user authentication possible
   - Blocks all authenticated functionality

2. **Airtable Integration Failure (Priority 2):**
   - All Airtable operations failing with 401 errors
   - Core business functionality unavailable
   - API configuration issues

3. **Missing Services (Priority 3):**
   - File service not accessible (affects file operations)
   - SAGA orchestrator not accessible (affects complex workflows)

### Warnings
- Service health could be improved (80% vs ideal 95%+)
- Concurrent performance needs optimization (50% success rate)
- Visual regression issues need attention
- Observability stack missing

- ‚úÖ Frontend completely functional  
- ‚úÖ Good performance characteristics
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test framework implemented

**Critical Gaps:**
- ‚ùå Authentication system completely broken
- ‚ùå Airtable integration non-functional  
- ‚ùå Missing key services (File, SAGA)
- ‚ùå No observability stack deployed

**Recommendation:** Focus on resolving authentication and API integration issues as the highest priority. With these fixes, the system could reach production readiness within 1-2 weeks.
