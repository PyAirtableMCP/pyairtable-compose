# SPRINT 3 REALISTIC ARCHITECTURE PLAN

**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Assessment By:** Solutions Architect  
**Current Status:** Foundation Repair Mode (35.7% system functionality)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: FOUNDATION BEFORE FEATURES

This Sprint 3 plan is based on the brutal reality check that shows **our system is fundamentally broken at the integration layer**. We have working individual components but they cannot communicate properly. This sprint focuses on **Foundation Repair** before any feature development.

**Success Metric:** Achieve 80%+ test success rate with working end-to-end flows.

---

## PART A: FOUNDATION REPAIR (Week 1)

### 1. CRITICAL PORT MAPPING FIXES

**Current Broken State:**
- Airtable Gateway: Container exposes port 8002, docker-compose maps 7002→7002 (wrong)
- Services cannot connect to each other due to incorrect port configurations
- Health checks fail because of port mismatches

**Specific Fix Required:**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/docker-compose.yml`
- **Line 134:** Change `"7002:7002"` to `"7002:8002"`
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/airtable-gateway/src/main.py`
- **Action:** Ensure service runs on port 8002 internally

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Test after fix
curl -f http://localhost:7002/health
# Should return healthy response, not empty reply
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Airtable gateway health endpoint returns 200 OK
- Container health check passes (currently UNHEALTHY)

### 2. DEPLOY MISSING CORE SERVICES

**Current Broken State:**
- MCP Server (8001): Connection refused - service not running
- API Gateway (8000): Not in current docker-compose.yml
- LLM Orchestrator (8003): Referenced but not deployed

**Specific Fix Required:**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/docker-compose.yml`
- **Action:** Add missing service definitions for api-gateway, llm-orchestrator, mcp-server (they exist in file but not running)
- **Command to test:** `docker-compose ps | grep -E "(api-gateway|llm-orchestrator|mcp-server)"`

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# All services should show as "Up" and "healthy"
docker-compose ps
curl -f http://localhost:8000/api/health  # API Gateway
curl -f http://localhost:8001/health      # MCP Server  
curl -f http://localhost:8003/health      # LLM Orchestrator
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All 3 services show "Up (healthy)" status
- Health endpoints return 200 OK responses

### 3. FIX AUTHENTICATION COMPLETELY

**Current Broken State:**
- Airtable operations: 100% failure rate with "Invalid API key" (401 errors)
- Login endpoint: Expects `email` but receives `username`
- No working session management

**Specific Fix Required:**

**A. Fix API Key Validation**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/airtable-gateway/src/middleware/auth.py`
- **Issue:** API key validation logic is rejecting valid tokens
- **Evidence:** AIRTABLE_TOKEN exists in .env but auth fails

**B. Fix Login Endpoint Format**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/platform-services/src/routes/auth.py`
- **Current:** Expects `{"email": "...", "password": "..."}`
- **Fix:** Accept both `email` and `username` fields, map appropriately

**C. Implement Session Management**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/platform-services/src/services/auth.py`
- **Missing:** JWT token generation and validation logic

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Test API key validation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(grep AIRTABLE_TOKEN .env | cut -d'=' -f2)" \
  http://localhost:7002/api/airtable/tables

# Test login with username
curl -X POST http://localhost:7007/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123"}'

# Should return JWT token, not field format error
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Airtable API calls return data, not 401 errors
- Login endpoint accepts username/email and returns valid JWT
- JWT tokens can be validated by platform-services

### 4. ESTABLISH ONE WORKING END-TO-END FLOW

**Target Flow:** User Registration → Login → Airtable Query → Response

**Current State:** 0% success rate on full workflow

**Specific Implementation:**

**A. Fix User Registration**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/platform-services/src/routes/auth.py`
- **Current Issue:** Registration works (20% pass rate) but created users can't login
- **Fix:** Ensure password hashing is consistent between registration and login

**B. Implement Basic Session Store**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/platform-services/src/services/session.py`
- **Redis Integration:** Store JWT tokens in Redis for validation
- **Current:** JWT_SECRET exists but no session logic

**C. Create Integration Test**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/tests/test_complete_workflow.py`
- **Flow:** Register user → Login → Get JWT → Query Airtable → Return data

**Verification Test:**
```python
# Complete E2E test
def test_complete_user_workflow():
    # 1. Register user
    register_response = requests.post("http://localhost:7007/auth/register", 
                                      json={"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123"})
    assert register_response.status_code == 201
    
    # 2. Login user  
    login_response = requests.post("http://localhost:7007/auth/login",
                                   json={"username": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123"})
    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    jwt_token = login_response.json()["access_token"]
    
    # 3. Query Airtable with JWT
    airtable_response = requests.get("http://localhost:7002/api/airtable/tables",
                                     headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt_token}"})
    assert airtable_response.status_code == 200
    assert len(airtable_response.json()["tables"]) > 0
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete workflow test passes without errors
- Each step returns expected response codes
- Data flows correctly between all services

---

## PART B: BASIC PRODUCTION FEATURES (Week 2)

### 5. BASIC ERROR RECOVERY (NOT COMPLEX CIRCUIT BREAKERS)

**Current State:** Services crash and don't restart, no retry logic

**Simple Implementation:**

**A. Service-Level Retry Logic**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/shared/retry_helper.py`
- **Function:** Simple retry decorator with exponential backoff
- **Usage:** Apply to Airtable API calls, database connections

**B. Container Restart Policies**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/docker-compose.yml`
- **Current:** `restart: unless-stopped` exists but services still unhealthy
- **Fix:** Add proper health checks with reasonable timeouts

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Kill a service and verify it restarts
docker kill pyairtable-compose-airtable-gateway-1
sleep 30
docker-compose ps | grep airtable-gateway
# Should show "Up" status, not "Exited"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Services automatically restart after crashes
- API calls retry 3x before failing
- System maintains 90%+ uptime during normal operations

### 6. SIMPLE HEALTH MONITORING (NOT COMPLEX OBSERVABILITY)

**Current State:** Grafana/Prometheus exist but no application metrics

**Basic Implementation:**

**A. Application Health Metrics**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/shared/health_metrics.py`
- **Metrics:** Request count, error rate, response time
- **Export:** Prometheus format at `/metrics` endpoint

**B. Simple Dashboard**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/monitoring/basic-dashboard.json`
- **Panels:** Service status, error rates, response times
- **Alerts:** Simple threshold-based alerts (error rate > 5%)

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Verify metrics endpoints exist
curl http://localhost:7007/metrics | grep request_count
curl http://localhost:7002/metrics | grep airtable_requests_total

# Check Grafana dashboard loads
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/dashboards/db/pyairtable-basic | grep title
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All services export basic Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboard displays service health
- Alerts fire when error rate exceeds threshold

### 7. BASIC CI/CD (GITHUB ACTIONS THAT ACTUALLY WORK)

**Current State:** No working CI/CD pipeline

**Simple Implementation:**

**A. Basic Build and Test Pipeline**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Steps:** Build Docker images, run test suite, publish results
- **Trigger:** On PR to main branch

**B. Simple Deploy Pipeline**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Steps:** Pull latest images, run docker-compose up, verify health
- **Environment:** Development environment only

**Verification Test:**
```yaml
name: Verify CI/CD
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run test suite
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
          # Should exit with code 0 (all tests pass)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- PR builds complete without errors
- Test suite passes in CI environment  
- Automated deployment to dev environment works

### 8. SIMPLE DEPLOYMENT SCRIPTS (DOCKER-COMPOSE BASED)

**Current State:** Complex docker-compose.yml but no deployment automation

**Simple Implementation:**

**A. One-Command Local Setup**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/deploy-local.sh`
- **Functions:** Environment setup, credential validation, service startup
- **Output:** Working system or clear error messages

**B. Production-Ready Configuration**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/docker-compose.production.yml`
- **Changes:** Remove dev volumes, add resource limits, secure configurations
- **Validation:** Health checks pass before marking deployment complete

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Test local deployment script
./deploy-local.sh
# Should result in all services healthy

# Test production configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
# All services should show "Up (healthy)"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- One command deploys entire system locally
- Production configuration passes security scan
- Deployment script includes rollback capability

### 9. BASIC SECURITY (ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, NOT COMPLEX VAULTS)

**Current State:** Credentials in .env file, some missing security headers

**Simple Implementation:**

**A. Secure Environment Management**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/.env.template`
- **Action:** Template with placeholder values, real .env in .gitignore
- **Validation:** Script to verify required variables exist

**B. Basic Security Headers**
- **File:** `/Users/kg/IdeaProjects/pyairtable-compose/python-services/shared/security_middleware.py`
- **Headers:** X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- **Rate Limiting:** Basic IP-based request limits

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Verify security headers
curl -I http://localhost:7007/health | grep -E "(X-Content-Type-Options|X-Frame-Options)"

# Verify rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do curl -s http://localhost:7007/auth/login > /dev/null; done
curl http://localhost:7007/auth/login
# Should return 429 Too Many Requests
```

**Success Criteria:**
- No credentials committed to repository
- All endpoints return security headers
- Basic rate limiting prevents abuse

---

## CONCLUSION: FOUNDATION BEFORE OPTIMIZATION

This Sprint 3 plan is **brutally realistic** about our current state. We have 35.7% functionality and need to get to 80%+ before any optimization work makes sense.

**The focus is Foundation Repair:**
- Fix what's broken (authentication, service communication, port configs)  
- Add basic production capabilities (monitoring, deployment, security)
- Create verifiable working system (not aspirational documentation)

**After Sprint 3 Success:** Only then can we consider performance optimization, advanced features, or complex architectural patterns. We need a working foundation before we can build anything on top of it.
