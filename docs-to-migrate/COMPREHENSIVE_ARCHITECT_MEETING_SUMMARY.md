## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Points

### 1. Microfrontend Architecture Feasibility

#### **Research Summary**
Based on 2025 industry best practices and current PyAirtable architecture:

**✅ Pros:**
- **Team Autonomy:** Enables independent frontend development
- **Technology Flexibility:** Can mix React, Vue, Angular per team preference
- **Deployment Independence:** Individual frontend modules deployable separately
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple customer interfaces (admin, tenant, mobile)
- **Fault Isolation:** Frontend failures contained to specific modules

**❌ Cons:**
- **Complexity Overhead:** Additional orchestration layer required
- **Bundle Size:** Potential for duplicate dependencies
- **Routing Complexity:** Cross-module navigation requires careful design
- **Integration Testing:** More complex E2E testing scenarios
- **Initial Development Cost:** 2-3x setup time compared to monolithic frontend

#### **Architecture Recommendation**

**Decision: DEFER microfrontend implementation**

**Rationale:**
1. **Current Priority:** Authentication and core functionality must be completed first
2. **Team Size:** Single frontend team doesn't require autonomous development yet
3. **Complexity vs. Value:** Current architecture serves needs adequately
4. **Timeline Impact:** Would delay production deployment by 4-6 weeks

**Future Consideration:** Reevaluate when:
- Multiple frontend teams exist
- Customer-specific customizations required
- Mobile and web apps diverge significantly

### 2. Frontend Authentication Strategy

#### **Immediate Solution (Next 2 Weeks)**
```typescript
Authentication Architecture:
  Pages: /auth/login, /auth/onboarding, /auth/verify
  Flow: Email → Password → Airtable PAT → Base Selection → Dashboard
  Implementation: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
  Backend Integration: Platform Services API (Port 8007)
  Security: HTTPS, secure cookies, CSRF protection
```

#### **Onboarding Experience**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Email/Password] --> B[Airtable PAT]
    B --> C[Base Selection]
    C --> D[Quick Tour]
    D --> E[Chat Interface]
```

### 3. Platform Services Deployment Strategy

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Environment Parity:** Deploy platform services across all environments
2. **Health Checks:** Implement comprehensive service health monitoring
3. **Database Migration:** Ensure auth and analytics schemas are current
4. **API Gateway Updates:** Route authentication requests properly

#### **Deployment Sequence**
```bash
# Phase 1: Infrastructure validation
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh platform-services

# Phase 2: Database migrations
./migrations/run-migrations.sh --schema=auth,analytics

# Phase 3: Service deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d platform-services

# Phase 4: Integration testing
./tests/run-all-tests.sh --focus=auth,platform
```
