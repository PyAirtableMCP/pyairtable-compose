# PRODUCTION INCIDENT RESPONSE - Force Merge Failure
**Date**: 2025-08-11 19:50 UTC  
**Incident ID**: INC-20250811-001  
**Severity**: P0 - Complete System Outage  
**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED  

## INCIDENT SUMMARY
Force merge of PR #19 to main branch resulted in complete system failure with 7/8 services down.

## TIMELINE

### 19:45 UTC - Incident Detected
- Force merge executed on PR #19 (feature/sprint-4-cleanup)
- System status: 3/9 services running (only PostgreSQL, Redis, 1 unhealthy service)
- **Impact**: Complete production outage

### 19:50 UTC - Emergency Assessment
- **Severity Classification**: P0 - Production down
- **Services Failed**: 7/8 application services completely offline
- **Root Cause**: Python import errors across all services
- **Decision**: IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK required

### 19:52 UTC - Emergency Rollback Initiated
```bash
# Emergency backup created
git tag emergency-backup-20250811-195200 HEAD

# System shutdown and rollback
docker-compose down
git reset --hard e2fef54bdf08dee6e5d377571a6597a87becb7dd
```

### 19:55 UTC - System Partially Restored
- **Current Status**: 4/9 services running
- **Healthy Services**: PostgreSQL, Redis, platform-services
- **Unhealthy**: airtable-gateway (functional but health check failing)
- **Missing**: 5 application services not started due to dependency issues

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### ‚úÖ HEALTHY SERVICES
1. **postgres** - Database layer operational
2. **redis** - Cache/session storage operational  
3. **platform-services** - Core platform functionality operational

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL
1. **airtable-gateway** - Service responding but marked unhealthy
   - Health endpoint working: `{"status":"healthy"}`
   - Docker health check misconfigured

### ‚ùå FAILED TO START
1. **api-gateway** - Main entry point DOWN
2. **llm-orchestrator** - AI processing DOWN
3. **mcp-server** - Protocol implementation DOWN
4. **automation-services** - Workflow engine DOWN
5. **saga-orchestrator** - Transaction coordinator DOWN
6. **frontend** - UI layer DOWN

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Pre-Merge State
- **Working**: 6/9 services healthy (as documented in PRE_MERGE_CHECKPOINT.md)
- **Failing**: 3 services with restart loops

### Post-Merge Impact  
- **Critical Error**: Python import failures across all services
- **Build Failures**: Docker containers unable to resolve dependencies
- **Service Dependencies**: Cascading failures due to missing telemetry modules

### Merge Complexity
- **Files Changed**: 519 files
- **Commits**: 10+ commits ahead of main
- **CI Status**: All checks failing at merge time

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

1. **Emergency Backup**: Created tag `emergency-backup-20250811-195200`
2. **Hard Reset**: Rolled back to commit `e2fef54` (pre-merge state)
3. **Service Restart**: Attempted to restore previous working state
4. **Status Assessment**: Confirmed partial restoration

## CURRENT BUSINESS IMPACT

### üî¥ CRITICAL FAILURES
- **API Gateway DOWN**: No external traffic routing
- **Frontend DOWN**: Complete UI outage
- **LLM Services DOWN**: AI functionality offline

### üü° PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY
- **Database Layer**: Data persistence working
- **Core Platform**: Basic services operational
- **Airtable Integration**: Functional but dependency issues

### ‚è±Ô∏è ESTIMATED RECOVERY TIME
- **Minimum Viable System**: 30-45 minutes
- **Full Restoration**: 1-2 hours
- **Complete Rollback Validation**: 2-4 hours

## NEXT STEPS (URGENT)

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
1. **Fix airtable-gateway health check**
2. **Manually start api-gateway service**
3. **Validate core API endpoints**

### Short-term (Next 60 minutes)  
1. **Restore all application services**
2. **Validate end-to-end functionality**
3. **Monitor for stability**

### Medium-term (Next 4 hours)
1. **Complete system validation**
2. **Performance monitoring**
3. **Incident post-mortem**

## ROLLBACK VERIFICATION

### Successful Elements
- ‚úÖ Database restored and operational
- ‚úÖ Cache layer functional  
- ‚úÖ Core platform services running
- ‚úÖ No data loss detected

### Remaining Issues
- ‚ùå Service orchestration not fully restored
- ‚ùå API routing layer down
- ‚ùå Frontend completely offline
- ‚ùå AI processing capabilities offline

## LESSONS LEARNED (PRELIMINARY)

1. **Never force merge with failing CI** - All 519 file changes should have been validated
2. **Dependency management critical** - Python import errors indicate broken dependencies
3. **Health check configuration** - Service health vs container health misalignment
4. **Rollback procedures work** - Emergency rollback commands were effective

## ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate
- [ ] Restore api-gateway service
- [ ] Fix airtable-gateway health check
- [ ] Validate database connectivity

### Follow-up  
- [ ] Complete post-mortem analysis
- [ ] Update deployment procedures
- [ ] Implement staged rollout process
- [ ] Fix CI/CD pipeline issues
