- [ ] CORS origins match your actual frontend domains
- [ ] CORS methods are limited to what's actually needed
- [ ] CORS headers are explicitly defined (no wildcards)

### üö¶ Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled on public endpoints
- [ ] Rate limits are appropriate for your use case
- [ ] Rate limiting covers both per-IP and per-API-key
- [ ] Burst limits are configured for legitimate spikes

### üîç Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] All non-public endpoints require authentication
- [ ] API key verification uses constant-time comparison
- [ ] Authentication failures are logged
- [ ] Session management (if used) is secure

## Development Security Practices

### üß™ Testing Security
- [ ] Security tests cover authentication failures
- [ ] Rate limiting is tested
- [ ] CORS configuration is tested
- [ ] Input validation is tested
- [ ] SQL injection protection is tested (if applicable)

### üìù Code Review Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] File uploads (if any) are properly validated

### üîê Dependency Security
- [ ] Dependencies are regularly updated
- [ ] Security advisories are monitored
- [ ] Vulnerable dependencies are patched quickly
- [ ] Only necessary dependencies are included

## Production Deployment Security

### üåç Environment Configuration
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set
- [ ] All required environment variables are set
- [ ] Secrets are managed by secure secret management system
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] Redis connections use authentication and SSL

### üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Services run with minimal privileges
- [ ] Network access is restricted (firewall rules)
- [ ] Database access is restricted to application only
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting is configured
- [ ] Log aggregation is configured securely

### üìä Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- [ ] Rate limit violations are alerted
- [ ] Unusual traffic patterns are detected
- [ ] Error rates are monitored
- [ ] Security-related metrics are tracked

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### üîÑ Regular Security Tasks

#### Weekly
- [ ] Review authentication failure logs
- [ ] Check rate limiting metrics
- [ ] Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Review error logs for security issues

#### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Audit user access and permissions
- [ ] Review CORS configuration for changes

#### Quarterly
- [ ] Conduct security audit using built-in tools
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Update security documentation

#### Annually
- [ ] Comprehensive security assessment
- [ ] Update security training
- [ ] Review and update security architecture
- [ ] Audit all service-to-service communications

### üö® Security Incident Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-1 hours)
- [ ] Identify affected systems and data
- [ ] Contain the incident (disable compromised accounts/keys)
- [ ] Assess the scope and impact
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

#### Short-term Actions (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Investigate root cause
- [ ] Implement temporary fixes
- [ ] Rotate compromised credentials
- [ ] Document the incident

#### Long-term Actions (1-7 days)
- [ ] Implement permanent fixes
- [ ] Update security measures
- [ ] Conduct post-incident review
- [ ] Update incident response procedures

## Security Validation Commands

### Environment Security Check
```bash
# Run security validation
python -c "
from pyairtable_common.security.utils import validate_environment_security
import json
result = validate_environment_security()
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
"
```

### Generate Secure API Key
```bash
# Generate a new secure API key
python -c "import secrets; print('API_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
```

### Test CORS Configuration
```bash
# Test CORS preflight request
curl -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-API-Key,Content-Type" \
  https://your-api-domain.com/api/chat
```

### Validate Security Headers
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://your-api-domain.com/health
```

## Security Configuration Templates

### Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy to your secure environment configuration
ENVIRONMENT=production
API_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))")
JWT_SECRET=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))")
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
REQUIRE_HTTPS=true
DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT=100/minute
BURST_RATE_LIMIT=200/minute
```

### Docker Secrets (for production)
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
secrets:
  api_key:
    external: true
  airtable_token:
    external: true
  gemini_api_key:
    external: true
```

## Security Tools Integration

### Static Analysis
- Use tools like `bandit` for Python security scanning
- Integrate security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

### Runtime Security
- Monitor authentication failures
- Track rate limiting violations
- Alert on suspicious activity patterns
- Log all security-relevant events

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- [ ] Personal data is properly protected
- [ ] Data retention policies are implemented
- [ ] Data export/deletion capabilities exist
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer compliance

### Industry Standards
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Security controls documented
- [ ] Regular security assessments conducted
- [ ] Incident response plan exists
