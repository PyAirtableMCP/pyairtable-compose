# PyAirtable Security Compliance Framework

This comprehensive security compliance implementation provides enterprise-grade security controls, monitoring, and compliance frameworks for the PyAirtable platform.

## Framework Overview

### 1. Security Framework Implementation
- **SOC 2 Type II Controls**: Comprehensive security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy controls
- **ISO 27001 Compliance**: Information security management system with 114 security controls
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Privacy-by-design with data protection impact assessments
- **Security Policies**: Comprehensive security governance framework

### 2. Application Security
- **OWASP Top 10 Protection**: Vulnerability remediation and secure coding practices
- **SAST Integration**: Static code analysis with security linting
- **DAST Setup**: Dynamic security testing and penetration testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in third-party libraries

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Network Hardening**: Zero-trust network architecture
- **Container Security**: Image scanning and runtime protection
- **Kubernetes Security**: CIS benchmarks and Pod Security Standards
- **Cloud Security**: AWS/GCP security posture management

### 4. Access Control & Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP/SMS/Hardware key support
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions with principle of least privilege
- **Privileged Access Management**: Just-in-time access with session recording
- **Identity Federation**: SAML/OIDC integration with enterprise IdPs

### 5. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Data Classification**: Automated PII/PHI detection and labeling
- **Privacy Controls**: Data minimization, retention, and right to erasure
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with integrity validation

### 6. Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Centralized log analysis and threat detection
- **SOC Operations**: 24/7 security monitoring with incident response
- **Threat Intelligence**: Automated IOC feeds and behavioral analysis
- **Compliance Reporting**: Real-time dashboards and audit trails

### 7. Compliance Automation
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous compliance validation
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated audit trail generation
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantitative risk scoring and remediation tracking
- **Compliance Dashboards**: Executive and operational security metrics
