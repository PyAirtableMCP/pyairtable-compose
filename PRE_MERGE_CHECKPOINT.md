## CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS

### Service Health Analysis (6/9 Healthy)

#### HEALTHY SERVICES ✅
1. **api-gateway** (Port 8000) - Main entry point - CRITICAL
2. **auth-service** (Port 8009) - Authentication - CRITICAL  
3. **llm-orchestrator** (Port 8003) - AI processing - CRITICAL
4. **platform-services** (Port 8007) - Core platform - CRITICAL
5. **postgres** - Database - CRITICAL
6. **redis** - Cache/sessions - CRITICAL

#### FAILING/UNHEALTHY SERVICES ❌
1. **airtable-gateway** (Port 8002) - Restarting every 17 seconds - CRITICAL
2. **saga-orchestrator** (Port 8008) - Restarting every 55 seconds - HIGH RISK
3. **user-service** (Port 8010) - Unhealthy state - CRITICAL
4. **workspace-service** (Port 8011) - Restarting every 39 seconds - CRITICAL

## CRITICAL SERVICE DEPENDENCIES

### MUST WORK POST-MERGE (Tier 1)
1. **api-gateway** - All traffic routes through this
2. **postgres** - All data storage
3. **redis** - Session management and caching
4. **auth-service** - User authentication
5. **airtable-gateway** - Core business logic integration

### HIGH PRIORITY (Tier 2)
1. **llm-orchestrator** - AI functionality
2. **platform-services** - Core platform features
3. **user-service** - User management
4. **workspace-service** - Workspace operations

### ACCEPTABLE DOWNTIME (Tier 3)
1. **saga-orchestrator** - Distributed transactions (can be rebuilt)
2. **automation-services** - File processing workflows
3. **frontend** - UI layer (can be deployed separately)

## EMERGENCY ROLLBACK COMMANDS

### Option A: Fast Rollback to Main
```bash
# Save current state first
git tag emergency-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) HEAD

# Hard reset to main
git checkout main
git reset --hard e2fef54bdf08dee6e5d377571a6597a87becb7dd
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# Restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option B: Selective Service Rollback
```bash
# If only specific services fail, rollback individual components
git checkout main -- docker-compose.yml
git checkout main -- go-services/auth-service/
git checkout main -- python-services/airtable-gateway/
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate airtable-gateway auth-service
```

### Option C: Nuclear Option
```bash
# Complete environment reset
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -af
git checkout main
git reset --hard e2fef54bdf08dee6e5d377571a6597a87becb7dd
./start-all-services.sh
```

## MERGE OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option A: Admin Merge (Bypass CI) - RECOMMENDED
**Pros**:
- Fastest execution
- No local complexity
- GitHub handles conflict resolution
- Maintains proper Git history

**Cons**:
- Bypasses all safety checks
- Could introduce breaking changes
- CI failures indicate real issues

**Risk Level**: HIGH but MANAGEABLE with proper monitoring

### Option B: Local Merge + Force Push
**Pros**:
- More control over merge process
- Can resolve conflicts manually
- Can test locally before push

**Cons**:
- More complex process
- Requires local conflict resolution
- Higher chance of user error
- With 519 files changed, very error-prone

**Risk Level**: VERY HIGH due to complexity

## CRITICAL PATHS THAT MUST NOT BREAK

1. **Authentication Flow**: `/api/auth/*` endpoints
2. **Health Checks**: `/health` and `/api/health` on all services
3. **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL connections for all services
4. **Airtable Integration**: Core business functionality
5. **API Gateway Routing**: Traffic distribution to backend services

## MONITORING CHECKLIST POST-MERGE

1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
   - [ ] All services start without errors
   - [ ] Health checks return 200 OK
   - [ ] Database connections successful
   - [ ] Redis connections functional

2. **Short-term (5-15 minutes)**:
   - [ ] Authentication flows work
   - [ ] API Gateway routes properly
   - [ ] Airtable integration functional
   - [ ] No memory leaks or crashes

3. **Medium-term (15-60 minutes)**:
   - [ ] All test suites pass
   - [ ] Performance metrics stable
   - [ ] No error spikes in logs
   - [ ] Frontend loads and functions

## DECISION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Option A (Admin Merge)**

**Reasoning**:
1. 6/9 services currently healthy provides good foundation
2. Main business logic (API Gateway, Auth, Database) is working
3. Failing services are primarily integration/orchestration layer
4. Quick rollback available if needed
5. Sprint 4 cleanup suggests this is maintenance/improvement work

**RISK MITIGATION**:
1. Have rollback commands ready to execute
2. Monitor service health immediately post-merge
3. Be prepared for 15-30 minutes of potential instability
4. Have team on standby for immediate fixes

## POST-MERGE ACTION PLAN

1. **Execute merge** via GitHub admin override
2. **Monitor services** - 5 minute intervals for first hour
3. **Fix failing services** in order of priority:
   - airtable-gateway (business critical)
   - user-service (authentication dependent)
   - workspace-service (user management)
   - saga-orchestrator (can be rebuilt)
4. **Validate critical paths** within 30 minutes
5. **Document any issues** for future prevention

---

**FINAL WARNING**: This is a high-risk operation with 519 files changed and failing CI. However, the core services are healthy and rollback is straightforward. Proceed with caution and immediate monitoring.
