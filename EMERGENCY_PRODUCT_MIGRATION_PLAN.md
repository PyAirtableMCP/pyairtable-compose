## 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### RISK 1: Service Extraction Failures
**Probability:** High (60%)  
**Impact:** Service unavailability  

**Mitigation:**
- Extract one service at a time with immediate rollback capability
- Maintain original code as backup during extraction
- Deploy to staging environment first with full testing
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime

### RISK 2: Database Migration Issues
**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** Data loss/corruption  

**Mitigation:**
- Full database backup before any migration step
- Point-in-time recovery capability tested
- Shadow database testing for all schema changes
- Read-only fallback mode for data protection

### RISK 3: Dependency Hell
**Probability:** High (70%)  
**Impact:** Build/deployment failures  

**Mitigation:**
- Freeze all dependency versions during migration
- Create dependency compatibility matrix
- Use Docker containers to isolate dependencies
- Gradual dependency standardization post-extraction

### RISK 4: Team Productivity Collapse
**Probability:** Medium (50%)  
**Impact:** Complete development stoppage  

**Mitigation:**
- Dedicated migration team (2-3 developers)
- Clear migration documentation and runbooks
- Daily standup meetings for coordination
- Escalation path for immediate issue resolution
