## Development Workflow

### For Each Story:

1. **Switch to Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/SCRUM-XX-story-name
   ```

2. **Development Process**
   - Analyze current issues in assigned services
   - Implement fixes based on technical specifications
   - Write/update unit tests for modified code
   - Test locally with docker-compose
   - Ensure integration tests pass

3. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   # Build and test the specific service
   docker-compose build [service-name]
   docker-compose up [service-name]
   
   # Run service-specific tests
   make test  # or equivalent test command
   ```

4. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Create PR with clear description of changes
   - Include testing performed and results
   - Add screenshots/logs showing functionality works
   - Link to respective Jira story
   - Request review from team members

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each service must have passing unit tests
- New functionality requires corresponding tests
- Test coverage should be maintained or improved

### Integration Testing
- Services must integrate properly with their dependencies
- API endpoints should be tested end-to-end
- Database operations should be verified

### Local Environment Testing
```bash
# Start all services for integration testing
docker-compose up -d

# Run comprehensive test suite
./run-comprehensive-e2e-tests.sh

# Check service health
./quick-health-check.sh
```

## Dependencies Between Stories

### Critical Path:
1. **SCRUM-15 (Auth System)** → **SCRUM-17 (Frontend)**: Frontend depends on working auth
2. **SCRUM-16 (Airtable)** → **SCRUM-18 (Automation)**: Automation workflows depend on Airtable integration
3. **SCRUM-18 (Automation)** → **SCRUM-19 (SAGA)**: SAGA orchestration manages automation transactions

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Start SCRUM-15 and SCRUM-16 in parallel (different engineers)
2. Begin SCRUM-17 after SCRUM-15 has basic auth working
3. Start SCRUM-18 after SCRUM-16 shows progress
4. Begin SCRUM-19 after SCRUM-18 foundation is solid

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups:
- Report progress on assigned stories
- Identify blockers and dependencies
- Coordinate integration points between services

### Blocker Resolution:
- Post in team chat immediately when blocked
- Schedule pair programming sessions for complex issues
- Escalate to tech lead if blocker persists > 4 hours

### Code Review Process:
- All PRs require at least 1 approval
- Focus on functionality, security, and maintainability
- Include integration testing results in PR description
