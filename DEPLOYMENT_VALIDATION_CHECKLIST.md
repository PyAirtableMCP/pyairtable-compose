## Deployment Validation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
- [ ] **Container Startup**
  ```bash
  # Run the deployment
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d --build
  
  # Check all containers are running
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml ps
  ```
  - All 7 containers (5 services + 2 databases) show "Up" status
  - No containers in "Restarting" or "Exited" state
  - Health checks show "healthy" where configured

- [ ] **Database Connectivity**
  ```bash
  # Test PostgreSQL
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres
  
  # Test Redis
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml exec redis redis-cli ping
  ```
  - PostgreSQL responds with "accepting connections"
  - Redis responds with "PONG"

- [ ] **Network Connectivity**
  ```bash
  # Run basic connectivity tests
  ./tests/smoke/basic-connectivity.sh
  ```
  - All port connectivity tests pass
  - All HTTP connectivity tests pass
  - Internal network connectivity confirmed
  - Container status tests pass

### Phase 2: Service Health Validation
- [ ] **Health Endpoints**
  ```bash
  # Test all service health endpoints
  curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Airtable Gateway
  curl http://localhost:8001/health  # MCP Server
  curl http://localhost:8003/health  # LLM Orchestrator
  curl http://localhost:8007/health  # Platform Services
  curl http://localhost:8006/health  # Automation Services
  ```
  - All endpoints return HTTP 200
  - JSON responses include "status": "healthy"
  - Response times under 500ms
  - Version information present

- [ ] **Service Health Tests**
  ```bash
  # Run comprehensive health tests
  ./tests/smoke/service-health.sh
  ```
  - Core services health tests pass
  - Service dependencies validated
  - Response times within acceptable limits
  - Metrics endpoints available (where configured)

- [ ] **Database Operations**
  ```bash
  # Run database connectivity tests
  ./tests/smoke/database-connectivity.sh
  ```
  - PostgreSQL connection and operations work
  - Redis connection and operations work
  - Database tables exist and accessible
  - Resource usage within normal limits

### Phase 3: Service Communication
- [ ] **API Endpoints**
  ```bash
  # Run service communication tests
  ./tests/integration/service-communication.sh
  ```
  - All API endpoints respond correctly
  - Service-to-service communication working
  - Authentication mechanisms functional
  - Error handling working properly

- [ ] **Internal Service Discovery**
  - Services can reach each other by container name
  - Network policies allow required communication
  - Service dependencies resolve correctly
  - Circuit breakers and retries configured

### Phase 4: AI Chat Functionality
- [ ] **Chat Endpoint Testing**
  ```bash
  # Run chat functionality tests
  ./tests/integration/chat-functionality.sh
  ```
  - Chat endpoint available and responding
  - Request validation working
  - Session management functional
  - Error handling for invalid requests

- [ ] **Integration Path Testing**
  - LLM Orchestrator → MCP Server communication
  - MCP Server → Airtable Gateway communication
  - End-to-end chat flow operational (with placeholders)
  - Response format validation

### Phase 5: Real Credential Testing (Customer Provided)
- [ ] **Environment Update**
  ```bash
  # Update .env with real credentials
  AIRTABLE_TOKEN=pat14.real_customer_token
  AIRTABLE_BASE=appCUSTOMER123456
  GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy-real_customer_key
  
  # Restart services
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml restart
  ```

- [ ] **Real Data Testing**
  ```bash
  # Test with real customer data
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/chat \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "message": "List all tables in my base",
      "session_id": "validation-test",
      "base_id": "'$AIRTABLE_BASE'"
    }'
  ```
  - Chat responds with actual table data
  - Airtable integration working with real base
  - Gemini AI responses are relevant and helpful
  - No authentication errors

- [ ] **Functional Validation with Real Data**
  ```bash
  # Test various chat commands
  ./scripts/test-chat.sh
  ```
  - "List tables" command works
  - "Show records from [table]" works
  - "Create a record" functionality works
  - Error handling for invalid operations

## Performance and Load Testing

  ```bash
  # Run basic load tests (if available)
  ./tests/performance/load-test.sh
  ```
  - System handles 5+ concurrent chat sessions
  - No performance degradation under light load
  - Memory usage remains stable
  - CPU usage within acceptable limits

### Resource Monitoring
- [ ] **Container Resource Usage**
  ```bash
  # Monitor resource usage
  docker stats --no-stream
  ```
  - No container using > 80% CPU consistently
  - No container using > 80% memory consistently
  - Disk usage growing at reasonable rate
  - Network traffic within expected ranges
