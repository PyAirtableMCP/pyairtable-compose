## 📈 Key Metrics

### Repository Transformation
- **Before**: 1 monorepo with 73,547 files
- **After**: 6 focused repositories with ~420 total files
- **Reduction**: **99.4%** file count reduction
- **Average repo size**: 70 files (target: <1000)

### Code Quality
- **PR Size**: All PRs <500 lines (achieved)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- **Small repositories** = Fast context switching
- **gRPC** = Efficient service communication
- **Go-first approach** = High performance
- **Clear boundaries** = Easier debugging

### What Didn't
- **Monorepo** = Context window exhaustion
- **100k line PRs** = Impossible to review
- **Hybrid architecture** = Confusion and duplication
